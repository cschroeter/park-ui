## [Unreleased]

## [0.15.0] - 2023-12-02

### Added

- Added `Kbd` component.
- Added `accent.text` to the list of semantic tokens. This token is used do display text in interactive elements like
  buttons and links.
- Added support to render components with different colors. Pass the `colorPalette` prop to the component to change its
  visual style. See the example below for more details.

```tsx
<Button colorPalette="red">Danger</Button>
```

### Changed

### Fixed

## [0.12.0] - 2023-10-20

### Changed

This is one of the biggest releases of Park UI so far. We've introduced a new way to configure presets, which will make
it easier to customize the theme to your needs. We've also replaced the default colors with
[Radix Colors](https://www.radix-ui.com/colors).

The tailwind config respects now to configure the preset colors:

```js
const { parkwindPlugin } = require('./dist')

module.exports = {
  plugins: [parkwindPlugin],
  parkUI: {
    accentColor: 'amber',
    grayColor: 'sand',
    borderRadius: '2xl',
  },
  // ...rest of your config
}
```
