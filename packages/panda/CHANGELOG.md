## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Added `Link` component.

### Changed

- Changed the background color of text that is selected by the user to match the `accent` color.
- Revised `IconButton` component.
- Revised `Code` component.

## [0.20.0] - 2023-10-22

### Added

- Added a default export to `@park-ui/panda-preset` for easier configuration. This will use `neutral` as accent and gray color with `borderRadius` of `sm`.

```jsx
import { defineConfig } from '@pandacss/dev'

export default defineConfig({
  presets: ['@pandacss/preset-base', '@park-ui/panda-preset'],
  // ...
})
```

To customize the Park UI preset, use the `createPreset` function as shown below:

```jsx
import { defineConfig } from '@pandacss/dev'
import { createPreset } from '@park-ui/panda-preset'

export default defineConfig({
  presets: [
    '@pandacss/preset-base',
    createPreset({
      accentColor: 'amber',
      grayColor: 'sand',
      borderRadius: 'none',
    }),
  ],
  // ...
})
```

### Changed

- Tweaked semantic color tokens for a more consistent look and feel.

## [0.19.0] - 2023-10-19

This is one of the biggest releases of Park UI so far. We've introduced a new way to configure presets, which will make
it easier to customize the theme to your needs. We've also replaced the default colors from `@pandacss/preset-base` with
[Radix Colors](https://www.radix-ui.com/colors).

The overall look and feel of Park UI has been improved as well. We've revised the `Card` and `Drawer` components and
tweaked many of the existing components to make them more consistent.

We've also started to work on a Taildwind CSS plugin that will allow you to use Park UI as a plugin in your Tailwind CSS
project. This is still a work in progress, but we're excited to share it with you soon.

In the light of these changes, we've renamed the `@park-ui/presets` package to `@park-ui/panda-preset`. We will continue
to support the old package name for the time being, but we recommend that you update your configuration to use the new
package name.

### Added

- `createPreset` function introduced for more convenient and flexible preset configuration. See the examples below for
  more details.
- Replaced default colors from `@pandacss/preset-base` with [Radix Colors](https://www.radix-ui.com/colors). This will
  allow us to provide more consistent colors when switching between light and dark mode.

### Changed

- Revised `Card` component.
- Revised `Drawer` component.

### Examples

**Before**: Extending Theme

```tsx
import { defineConfig } from '@pandacss/dev'

export default defineConfig({
  presets: ['@pandacss/preset-base', '@park-ui/panda-preset'],
  theme: {
    extend: {
      tokens: {
        colors: {
          grayPalette: {
            25: { value: '#fcfcfc' },
            // etc ..
          },
        },
      },
      semanticTokens: {
        colors: {
          accent: {
            default: { value: { base: '{colors.indigo.500}', _dark: '{colors.indigo.200}' } },
            // etc ..
          },
        },
      },
    },
  },
  // ...
})
```

    createPreset({
      accentColor: 'amber',
