## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- No longer requires a `tsconfig.json` to install components using the CLI. This benefits users with setups like `nx` workspaces that lack a `tsconfig.json` file.

The CLI now prompts:

```text
➜ Which JS framework do you use? [React / Solid / Vue]
➜ Where would you like to store your components? [./src/components/ui]
```

Adding a component will create the following folder structure:

```text
➜ /src/components/ui/
  |-- styled/
  |   |-- utils/
  |   |   `-- create-style-context.ts
  |   `-- button.tsx
  `-- button.tsx
```

## [0.8.0] - 2024-07-29

### Changed

- **Removed support for barrel files**: `index.ts` files will no longer be created by default. Import components directly from their respective folders.

```jsx
// Before
import { Button } from '~/components/ui'

// After
import { Button } from '~/components/ui/button'
```
