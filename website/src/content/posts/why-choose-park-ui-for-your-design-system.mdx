You've been there: You install a popular UI component library, everything works great - until you need to customize that one button variant. Suddenly, you're writing CSS overrides, wrapping components in HOCs, and fighting with `!important` tags just to change a border radius.

This is the component library paradox. Traditional NPM-based libraries lock you into their API decisions. Customization requires workarounds and style overrides. You're stuck waiting for maintainers to fix bugs or add features you need today. And when you mix components from different libraries? Inconsistent UX across your entire application.

Park UI flips the script entirely by giving you the source code directly - offering complete control without sacrificing beauty or accessibility.

## The Open Code Philosophy

Unlike traditional component libraries, Park UI distributes components as source code, not NPM packages. This simple shift changes everything.

Every component lives directly in your codebase. You get full visibility into implementation and styling with no black boxes or abstracted APIs. Need a new button variant? Edit the recipe directly. No more CSS overrides or complex theming APIs. Changes that would take hours in traditional libraries take minutes with Park UI.

This approach is also future-ready for the AI-assisted development era. LLMs can read and understand your components, and AI tools can generate modifications that fit seamlessly into your design system. And when you find a bug? Fix it yourself. Debug and patch issues directly in your codebase and ship fixes on your timeline, not the library maintainer's.

## Built on Battle-Tested Foundations

Park UI isn't built from scratch. It's built on proven technologies: Ark UI and Panda CSS.

Ark UI provides accessible, framework-agnostic component logic. It handles complex interactions like modals, dropdowns, and date pickers with a composable architecture that works identically across React, Vue, Svelte and Solid.js. The predictable API works great for both developers and AI tools.

Panda CSS brings modern styling with zero runtime cost through build-time CSS generation. You get type-safe styling with autocomplete, no CSS-in-JS performance overhead, and a powerful theming system.

The result? You get accessibility and interaction logic from Ark UI, beautiful customizable design from Park UI recipes, and complete control since everything lives in your codebase.

## Beautiful by Default, Customizable by Design

Developed in collaboration with Brains & Pixels, Park UI provides a systematic design approach that looks professional out of the box.

Component sizing is consistent across the board. Primary components like buttons and inputs share heights per size token. For example, a medium button and medium input are both exactly 40px tall. Secondary components like badges and checkboxes align perfectly alongside them.

Five standardized variants work across all components: solid for high-contrast CTAs, subtle for badges and tags, surface for cards and containers, outline for secondary actions, and plain for text buttons and links. This guarantees visual harmony when mixing components.

The advanced color system built on Radix Colors provides 12 shades per mode with light and dark mode support out of the box. You get more flexibility than traditional 11-shade scales with natural color pairings for harmonious UIs.

Park UI also includes thoughtful design tokens like nested border radius values (l1, l2, l3) and adaptive shadows that work in both light and dark modes. There's even Figma integration with a free Foundations Kit and Pro Kit for seamless designer-to-developer workflow.

## One API, Multiple Frameworks

Park UI supports React, and Solid.js with a consistent API across all three frameworks. This means you learn once and use everywhere. You can switch frameworks without relearning component APIs, share design systems across different projects, and future-proof against framework trends.

Getting components into your project is simple. Use the CLI with `npx @park-ui/cli add button` or browse the documentation and copy source code directly. No bloated dependencies for components you'll never use.

## Developer Experience That Scales

Park UI integrates seamlessly with existing Panda CSS projects. Initialize with `npx @park-ui/cli init` and add components as needed. Because the code lives in your repository, you never have to worry about dependency updates breaking your UI or fighting with library APIs during upgrades.

The AI-enhanced workflow is particularly powerful. Components are structured for LLM understanding, so AI can generate new components that match your existing system. Consistent patterns make AI assistance more effective than with traditional black-box libraries.

## When Should You Use Park UI?

Park UI is perfect for projects requiring heavy customization, teams building custom design systems, and startups that need to move fast while owning their code. If accessibility is non-negotiable or you're embracing AI-assisted development, Park UI is an excellent choice.

However, if you need a completely plug-and-play solution with zero customization, prefer complete abstraction from component internals, or are building a quick prototype that won't need customization, you might want to consider alternatives.

## Getting Started

Getting started with Park UI takes just minutes. You'll need an existing Panda CSS setup, then install the Ark UI and Lucide Icons dependencies. Initialize with `npx @park-ui/cli init`, add your first component with `npx @park-ui/cli add button`, and start customizing by editing component recipes to match your brand.

## Own Your Component Library

Park UI represents a paradigm shift in how we think about component libraries. Traditional libraries optimize for getting started quickly, but they become obstacles as your needs evolve. Park UI optimizes for long-term success by giving you ownership from day one.

You get complete control with source code in your repository, a beautiful foundation you can customize to match your brand, solid ground from Ark UI and Panda CSS for accessibility and performance, framework flexibility across React, and Solid.js, and a future-ready AI-friendly architecture.

What could you build if you had complete control over every aspect of your component library without sacrificing quality or accessibility?
