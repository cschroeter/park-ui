Big news! **Park UI is officially joining the Chakra UI organization on GitHub**. 🎉

## A Natural Homecoming

If you've been following along, this probably feels less like a surprise and more like an inevitability.

Park UI was created by Christian Busch ([@grizzly_codes](https://twitter.com/grizzly_codes)), a core member of the Chakra team who helped shape Ark UI and Panda CSS. From day one, Park UI was built on Chakra's foundations—Ark UI for headless components and Panda CSS for styling. The design philosophy even influenced Chakra UI v3.

Now it's official. The family is together.

## What This Means for You

**Nothing breaks.** Your imports stay the same, your components keep working, and the docs remain at [park-ui.com](https://park-ui.com). What you *will* see is tighter integration, more resources, and faster iteration as Park UI benefits from the full support of the Chakra organization.

## One Ecosystem, One Roof

The Chakra org now offers a complete toolkit for building accessible, beautiful interfaces:

- **Zag** — State machines for UI components
- **Ark UI** — Headless, accessible components  
- **Panda CSS** — Build-time CSS-in-JS
- **Park UI** — Beautiful, open code components
- **Chakra UI** — The full-featured component system

Each layer builds on the one before it. Same design tokens, consistent patterns, unified vision.

## What's Next

The repository will move to `github.com/chakra-ui/park-ui` in the coming days. We're also working on an expanded component library, enhanced documentation, and continued support for React, Solid.js, and more frameworks.

## Thank You

Park UI grew from a side project into a tool used by thousands of developers. That happened because of you—every issue filed, every PR submitted, every Discord message. This next chapter isn't an ending. It's an amplification.

Welcome home, Park UI. 🏡
