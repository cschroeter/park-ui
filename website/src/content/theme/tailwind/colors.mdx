Derived from the [Radix Colors](https://www.radix-ui.com/colors), Park UI's color palette maintains a balance between
accessibility and brand identity, with some tweaks to its naming scheme.

## Gray Colors

Grays are integral for achieving visual balance. They provide contrast and direct the user's attention to key elements.

## Accent Colors

Accents define the primary tone of the UI and play a significant role in shaping brand recognition.

## Virtual Colors

Park UI's theme primarily revolves around one gray and one accent color. Below, discover the virtual colors configured
in your current theme.

## Harmonizing Gray and Accent

By default, Park UI pairs `neutral` for both gray and accent colors. But there's flexibility! Choose any color from the
Park UI palette to customize your theme.

### Neutral Pairing

For a minimalist or neutral feel, stick with `neutral`. It's versatile and complements various hues.

### Natural Pairing

For a richer look, select a gray scale tinted with a hue close to your accent. Itâ€™s a subtle shift, but results in a
harmonious, vibrant aura.
