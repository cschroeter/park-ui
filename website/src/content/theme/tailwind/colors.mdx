Derived from the [Radix Colors](https://www.radix-ui.com/colors), Park UI's color palette maintains a balance between
accessibility and brand identity, with some tweaks to its naming scheme.

## Gray Colors

Grays are integral for achieving visual balance. They provide contrast and direct the user's attention.

## Accent Colors

Accents define the primary tone of the UI and play a significant role in shaping brand recognition.

## Color Pairings

Park UI's theme primarily revolves around one gray and one accent color. By default, Park UI uses `neutral` for both
gray and accent colors. But there's flexibility! Choose any color from the Park UI palette to customize your theme.

### Neutral Pairing

For a minimalist or neutral feel, stick with `neutral` for the gray shade while pairing it with any accent color of your
choice.

### Natural Pairing

For a richer look, select a gray scale tinted with a hue close to your accent. Itâ€™s a subtle shift, but results in a
harmonious, vibrant aura. Here are some examples:
