Park UI's color palette is designed to be accessible and consistent. It is based on the
[Radix Colors](https://www.radix-ui.com/colors) and has been slightly modified to match Park UI's naming scheme.

## Gray Colors

Gray colors play a crucial role in establishing visual balance, providing contrast, and guiding users' focus on
essential elements.

## Accent Colors

Accent colors serve as the foundation for the entire color scheme of a user interface. These colors play a pivotal role
in establishing the brand identity.

## Virtual Colors

Park UI theme is built on one gray and one accent color. Here you can see the virtual colors that are currently
configured in the theme.

## Composing gray and accent

By default, Park UI uses `neutral` as the gray color and accent color. However, you can change these colors to any other
color in the Park UI color palette.

### Neutral pairing

If you want a neutral vibe, or you want to keep things simple, `neutral` will work well with any hue or palette.

### Natural pairing

Alternatively, choose the gray scale which is saturated with the hue closest to your accent hue. The difference is
subtle, but this will create a more colorful and harmonius vibe.
