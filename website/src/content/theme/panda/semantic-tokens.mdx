## Colors

Park UI's themeprimarily revolves around one gray and one accent color.. These foundational colors are later utilized to
define the `bg` (background), `fg` (foreground), and `accent` tokens.

### Gray

<ColorPalette color="gray" withLegend />

### Accent

<ColorPalette color="accent" withLegend />

### Background

Background colors are designated for the backdrop elements of a user interface. They can be used for components like
containers, sections, or the entire screen's layout.

<ColorTokens type="bg" />

### Foreground

Foreground colors are meant for elements that stand out against the background, such as text, icons, buttons, and other
interactive components.

<ColorTokens type="fg" />

### Accent

Accent colors are pivotal in directing the user's attention to specific actions, content, or interactive elements.

<ColorTokens type="accent" />

### Border

Border tokens contribute depth to UI elements. They establish hierarchy and delineate between components.

<ColorTokens type="border" />

## Shadows

Shadows provide depth to UI components, emphasizing a layered appearance and hierarchical structure.

## Radii

`l1`, `l2`, and `l3` are tokens to create rounded corners. `l1` is for basic rounding, `l2` is for wrapping `l1` items,
and `l3` wraps `l2` items
