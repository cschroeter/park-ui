Based on [Radix Colors](https://www.radix-ui.com/colors), Park UI's color palette balances accessibility with customization options.

## Gray Colors

Gray colors provide contrast and visual hierarchy in your interface.

<ColorGrid type="gray" />

## Accent Colors

Accent colors establish your interface's primary visual tone.

<ColorGrid type="accent" />

## Color Pairings

Park UI themes use one gray and one accent color. The default configuration uses `neutral` for both gray and accent colors. You can select any color from the palette to customize your theme.

### Neutral Pairing

Use `neutral` for the gray shade and pair it with any accent color for a clean, minimalist appearance.

### Natural Pairing

Select a gray scale that complements your chosen accent color. This creates visual cohesion between your gray and accent colors.
