Park UI builds on the default [Panda Preset](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@pandacss/preset-panda). To achieve a consistent, minimal design system, it introduces a few key adjustments to the standard Panda configuration.

## Colors

The biggest change Park UI introduces is its color system. Instead of the `50â€“950` scale used in Panda CSS, Park UI is built on [Radix Colors](https://www.radix-ui.com/colors).
Each color comes with 12 shades per mode (light and dark), for a total of 24 shades. This provides finer control and greater flexibility than the traditional 11-shade scale.

### Color Pairings

Park UI is built around the concept of one accent color and one gray color. When initializing your project, you'll choose which combination works best for you.


#### Neutral Pairings

If you want a neutral vibe, or you want to keep things simple, `neutral` will work well with any hue or palette.

#### Natural pairing

Alternatively, choose the gray scale which is saturated with the hue closest to your accent hue. The difference is subtle, but this will create a more colorful and harmonius vibe.
