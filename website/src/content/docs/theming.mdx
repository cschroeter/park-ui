Park UI extends the default [Panda Preset](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@pandacss/preset-panda) with a minimal, systematic design approach. It introduces key adjustments to component sizing and variants to ensure alignment and visual consistency across your UI.

## Components

Park UI components are designed with consistent sizing and standardized variants to ensure visual harmony across your interface.

### Sizing

Park UI organizes component sizing into two categories:

* **Primary components** — core interactive elements that drive user actions (e.g., Buttons, Inputs, Selects).
* **Secondary components** — supporting elements that complement primary interactions (e.g., Badges, Checkboxes, Switches).

This categorization establishes a clear hierarchy and guarantees alignment. Components within the same category share identical heights for a given size token. For example, both a `md` Button and a `md` Input are exactly `40px` tall, ensuring perfect alignment when placed together.

### Variants

Variants are standardized across components for a unified look and feel. Park UI defines five shared variants:

* `solid`
* `subtle`
* `surface`
* `outline`
* `plain`

This consistency allows you to combine components without worrying about mismatched styles. Using the same variant across elements guarantees visual harmony.

#### Solid

High-contrast background with inverted foreground. Use for primary CTAs, submit buttons, and main actions.

<VariantPreview variant="solid" />

#### Subtle

Tinted background with matching foreground. Use for badges, tags, selected states, and secondary highlights.

<VariantPreview variant="subtle" />

#### Surface

Background with visible border and hover states. Use for cards, menu items, selectable lists, and elevated containers.

<VariantPreview variant="surface" />

#### Outline

Border-only with transparent background. Use for secondary actions, cancel buttons, filters, and tertiary controls.

<VariantPreview variant="outline" />

#### Plain

Minimal style with background on interaction. Use for text buttons, links, tabs, and ghost actions.

## Colors

The biggest change Park UI introduces is its color system. Instead of the `50–950` scale used in Panda CSS, Park UI is built on [Radix Colors](https://www.radix-ui.com/colors). Each color comes with 12 shades per mode (light and dark), for a total of 24 shades. This provides finer control and greater flexibility than the traditional 11-shade scale.

### Gray

### Accent

### Pairings

Park UI is built around the concept of one accent color and one gray color. When initializing your project, you'll choose which combination works best for you.

#### Neutral Pairings

If you want a neutral vibe, or you want to keep things simple, `neutral` will work well with any hue or palette.

#### Natural pairing

Alternatively, choose the gray scale which is saturated with the hue closest to your accent hue. The difference is subtle, but this will create a more colorful and harmonious vibe.

## Tokens

### Border Radius

Radii tokens define consistent corner rounding across components. This setup makes it easy to nest border radii as shown below.

* **`l1`** – smallest radius, used inside other elements
* **`l2`** – medium radius, used when wrapping `l1`
* **`l3`** – largest radius, used when wrapping `l2`

### Shadows

Shadows provide consistent elevation levels, from `xs` to `2xl`. Unlike the default Panda shadows, they adapt seamlessly to both light and dark mode.
