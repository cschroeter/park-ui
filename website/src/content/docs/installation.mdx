## Setup Guide

<Steps>
<Step title="Prerequisite" number="1">

Before you start, ensure that your Panda project is set up and ready to go. 
If not, please refer to the [Panda CSS Getting Started Guide](https://panda-css.com/docs/overview/getting-started) and once you've completed that, come back to this guide.

</Step>
<Step title="Install Dependencies" number="2">

Park UI requires [Ark UI](https://ark-ui.com), a headless component library for building design systems.
It provides the foundational components that Park UI builds upon.

```bash multi
npm install @ark-ui/react
```

</Step>
<Step number="3" title="Initialize Park UI">

Next, initialize Park UI in your project. This will set up the necessary configuration files and directories.


```bash
npx @park-ui/cli@next init
```

Don't forget to run `panda codegen` after updating your Panda configuration.

</Step>

<Step number="4" title="Add components">

You can now start adding components to your project.

```bash
npx @park-ui/cli@next add button
```

The command above will add the Button component to your project. You can then import it like this:

```tsx
import { Button } from '@/components/ui'

export default function Home() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Button>Park UI</Button>
    </div>
  )
}
```

That's it! Happy hacking! ✌️
</Step>

## Additional configuration

If you need to customise the import path for styled-system because of TypeScript configuration, you can do so by updating the `park-ui.config.json` file.

```json
{
  "framework": "react",
  "paths": {
    "components": "./src/components/ui",
    "theme": "./src/theme"
  },
  "imports": {
    "styled-system-base": "./app/styled-system"
  }
}
```
