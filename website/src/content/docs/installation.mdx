## Setup Guide

<Steps>
<Step title="Prerequisite" number="1">

Before you start, ensure that your Panda project is set up and ready to go. 
If not, please refer to the [Panda CSS Getting Started Guide](https://panda-css.com/docs/overview/getting-started) and once you've completed that, come back to this guide.

</Step>
<Step title="Install Dependencies" number="2">

Park UI is built on [Ark UI](https://ark-ui.com) as its headless foundation and uses [Lucide Icons](https://lucide.dev) by default, but you can swap it out for any icon library of your choice.

```bash multi
npm install @ark-ui/react lucide-react
```

</Step>
<Step number="3" title="Initialize Park UI">

Next, initialize Park UI in your project. This will set up the necessary configuration files and directories.


```bash
npx @park-ui/cli@next init
```

Don't forget to run `panda codegen` after updating your Panda configuration.

</Step>

<Step number="4" title="Add components">

You can now start adding components to your project.

```bash
npx @park-ui/cli@next add button
```

The command above will add the Button component to your project. You can then import it like this:

<ComponentExample component="Button" name="basic" codeOnly />

That's it! Happy hacking! ✌️
