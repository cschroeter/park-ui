Dive into Park UI design fundamentals with the Foundations Kit. It packs all you need: variables, styles, and essential UI components—buttons, inputs, radios, and more.

Use Accent Variable Mode for easy switching between classic and custom colors. Works in Figma directly, supporting both light and dark modes.
