<ComponentExample name="basic" />

## Installation

<InstallationGuide />

## Usage

```tsx
import { Toaster, toaster } from "@/components/ui"
```

First, render the `Toaster` component in the root of your application.

```tsx
<Toaster />
```

Then, create a toast by calling the `toaster` function.

```tsx
toaster.create({
  title: "Toast Title",
  description: "Toast Description",
})
```

## Examples

### Closable 

Set the `closable` prop to `true` to create a closable toast.

<ComponentExample name="closable" />

### External Close

Use the `toaster.dismiss` method to close a toast.

- `toaster.dismiss(id)`: Dismiss a toast by its id.
- `toaster.dismiss()`: Dismiss all toasts.


<ComponentExample name="external-close" />

### Types

Here's an example of each type of toast.

<ComponentExample name="types" />

### With Action

Use the `action` and `actionLabel` prop to add an action to the toast.

> When the action trigger is clicked, the toast will be closed.

<ComponentExample name="action" />

### Promise

Use the `toaster.promise` to create a toast that resolves when the promise is resolved.

Next, you can define the toast options (title, description, etc.) for each state of the promise.

<ComponentExample name="promise" />

### Custom Duration

Use the `duration` prop to set the duration of the toast.

<ComponentExample name="duration" />

### Maximum Visible Toasts

Set the `max` prop on the `createToaster` function to define the maximum number of toasts that can be rendered at any one time.
Any extra toasts will be queued and rendered when a toast has been dismissed.

```tsx
const toaster = createToaster({
  max: 3,
})
```

### Placement

Toasts can be displayed on all four corners of a page. We recommend picking one desired position and configure it in the `createToaster` function.

```tsx
const toaster = createToaster({
  placement: "top-end",
})

```
### Stacked Toasts

By default, toasts overlap each other. To make the toasts stack on top of each other, set the `overlap` prop to `false` in the `createToaster` function.

```tsx
const toaster = createToaster({
  placement: "top-end",
  overlap: false,
})
```

### Page Idle Behavior

Pause toast timers when the page is idle/hidden.

```tsx
const toaster = createToaster({
  pauseOnPageIdle: true,
})
```

### Offset

Set the `offsets` prop in the `createToaster` function to offset the toasts from the edges of the screen.

```tsx
const toaster = createToaster({
  offsets: "20px",
})
```

Alternatively, you can use the `offsets` prop to set the offset for each edge of the screen.

```tsx
const toaster = createToaster({
  offsets: { left: "20px", top: "20px", right: "20px", bottom: "20px" },
})
```
