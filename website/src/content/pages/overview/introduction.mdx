## Motivation

Many popular component libraries are tailored to specific JavaScript frameworks and adhere to particular UI designs. While this approach may suit individuals and small businesses, it often presents challenges for larger organizations or agencies working with diverse clients and teams using different JS frameworks.

Additionally, most component libraries tightly couple design and functionality, making customization difficult and sometimes impossible.

## Solution

Introducing Park UI. Our goal is to give you control over how components are built and styled. Park UI offers a set of components with sensible defaults that can be easily customized to meet your needs.

Unlike many other component libraries, Park UI isn't shipped as a single npm package. Instead, you can install only the components you need. If you want the full design system, you can install the Panda CSS Park UI Preset. You will learn more in the next section.
