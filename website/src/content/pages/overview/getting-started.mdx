## Setup Guide

<Steps>
<Step title="Prerequisite" number="1">

Before you start, ensure that your Panda project is set up and ready to go. If not, please refer to the
[Panda CSS Getting Started Guide](https://panda-css.com/docs/overview/getting-started#framework-guides) and once you've
completed that, come back to this guide.

</Step>
<Step title="Install Ark UI" number="2">

The first step is to install [Ark UI](https://ark-ui.com). Ark UI is a headless component library that forms the
foundation for most components. To install Ark UI, execute the following command in your project's root directory:

```bash multi
npm install @ark-ui/react
```

</Step>
<Step number="3" title="Install the Panda Presets">

The next package you will need is `@park-ui/panda-preset`. This package contains all the recipes and tokens explicitly
built for Ark UI's headless components.

```bash
npm install @park-ui/panda-preset -D
```

After you've installed the presets, you'll need to add it to your Panda configuration file along with your preferred
`jsxFramework` like shown below:

```tsx multi
import { defineConfig } from '@pandacss/dev'

export default defineConfig({
  preflight: true,
  presets: ['@pandacss/preset-base', '@park-ui/panda-preset'],
  include: ['./src/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}'],
  exclude: [],
  jsxFramework: 'react', // or 'solid' or 'vue'
  outdir: 'styled-system',
})
```

> Ensure you run `panda codegen` after adding the presets to your Panda configuration file.

</Step>
<Step number="4" title="Path Aliases">

To streamline the integration of code snippets without the need to update import statements, we recommend setting up path aliases. <br />
To implement path aliases, modify your `tsconfig.json` file as follows:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    // Your other options...
    "baseUrl": ".",
    "paths": {
      "~/*": ["./src/*"]
    }
  },
  "include": ["src", "styled-system"]
}
```

If you are using [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/), it is necessary to include the `vite-tsconfig-paths` plugin in your config file:

```ts
import { defineConfig } from 'vite'
import tsconfigPaths from 'vite-tsconfig-paths'

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [tsconfigPaths({ root: './' })],
})
```
</Step>

<Step number="5" title="Adding Components to Your Project">


Although you can manually add components, we recommend using the Park UI CLI for efficiency.
To add a single component, run:

```bash
npx @park-ui/cli components add button
```

If a `park-ui.json` file is not found in your project, the CLI will prompt you to set up the configuration by asking:

```txt
- Which JS framework do you use? [React / Solid / Vue]
- Would you like to customize the default import alias? [~/*]
- Where would you like to store your components? [~/components/ui]
- Where would you like to store helper functions? [~/lib]
```

To add multiple components at once, separate their names with spaces:

```bash
npx @park-ui/cli components add avatar button card
```

To add all available components at once, use the `--all` flag:

```bash
npx @park-ui/cli components add --all
```

And that's it! Happy hacking! ✌️
