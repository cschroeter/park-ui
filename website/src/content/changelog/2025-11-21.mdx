## Park UI Gets a Major Upgrade 🎉

We've made some big changes to make Park UI more transparent and easier to customize.

### No More Preset

We're saying goodbye to `@park-ui/panda-preset`. While it served us well in the early days, it became a black box that made customization harder than it should be. Now when you add a component, you'll get its recipe too, right in your codebase where you can see it and tweak it. Want to add a new variant or adjust sizing? Just edit the code directly. No more fighting against a preset.

### Fresh Look, Better Experience

The website got a complete makeover with improved navigation and a handy command menu. We've also added way more examples for each component, complete with code snippets and props tables. Oh, and you can now grab page content as markdown, which is perfect if you're working with LLMs.

The CLI also got some love with a complete rewrite for better DX and improved support for tsconfig paths and extends.

### More Components, More Options

We've added seven new components and updated existing ones with more [variants](/docs/theming#variants) and [size](/docs/theming#sizing) options. Check out the [theming docs](/docs/theming) to learn more about the improved design system.

### Breaking Changes

Heads up: we renamed `RadioButtonGroup` to `RadioCardGroup` and removed `FormLabel` (it's now part of `Field`).

### What's Next

Next up on the roadmap: `DatePicker`, `ColorPicker`, and `TreeView`.
