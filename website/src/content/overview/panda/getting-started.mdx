## Setup Guide

<Steps>
<Step title="Prerequisite" number="1">

Before you start, ensure that your Panda project is set up and ready to go. If not, please refer to the
[Panda CSS Getting Started Guide](https://panda-css.com/docs/overview/getting-started#framework-guides) and once you've
completed that, come back to this guide.

</Step>
<Step title="Install Ark UI" number="2">

The first step is to install [Ark UI](https://ark-ui.com). Ark UI is a headless component library that forms the
foundation for most components. To install Ark UI, execute the following command in your project's root directory:

```bash multi
npm install @ark-ui/react
```

</Step>
<Step number="3" title="Install the Panda Presets">

The next package you will need is `@park-ui/presets`. This package contains all the recipes and tokens explicitly built
for Ark UI's headless components.

```bash
npm install @park-ui/presets
```

After you've installed the presets, you'll need to add it to your Panda configuration file along with your preferred
`jsxFramework` like shown below:

```tsx multi
import { defineConfig } from '@pandacss/dev'

export default defineConfig({
  preflight: true,
  presets: ['@pandacss/preset-base', '@park-ui/presets'],
  include: ['./src/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}'],
  exclude: [],
  jsxFramework: 'react',
  outdir: 'styled-system',
})
```

Make sure to run `panda codegen` after you've added the presets to your Panda configuration file.

**Please note:** You also have the option to manually copy the recipes for specific components, which are provided
alongside the code examples. This approach gives you more control over which components to include in your project.
However, it will require a bit more effort on your part.

</Step>
<Step number="4" title="Setup Your Font Family">

By default, Park UI usees Plus Jakarta Sans. However, you are free to use any font family that aligns with your needs,
as long as it is mapped to the `--font-body` variable. The example below illustrates how to add a font family to the
body element within the Next.js framework.

```tsx
import type { Metadata } from 'next'
import { Plus_Jakarta_Sans } from 'next/font/google'
import { PropsWithChildren } from 'react'
import './global.css'

const body = Plus_Jakarta_Sans({ subsets: ['latin'], variable: '--font-body' })

export const metadata: Metadata = {
  title: 'Create Next App',
  description: 'Generated by create next app',
}

export default function RootLayout(props: PropsWithChildren) {
  return (
    <html lang="en">
      <body className={body.variable}>{props.children}</body>
    </html>
  )
}
```

</Step>
<Step number="5" title="Add your first component">

To add a component, simply copy the code for the desired component and paste it into the appropriate place in your
project. Let's demonstrate this process using the `Button` component. First, copy the code for the component:

```tsx multi
import { ark, type HTMLArkProps } from '@ark-ui/react'
import { styled } from 'styled-system/jsx'
import { button, type ButtonVariantProps } from 'styled-system/recipes'

export type ButtonProps = ButtonVariantProps & HTMLArkProps<'button'>
export const Button = styled(ark.button, button)
```

and paste it into your `components/button.tsx` file. Now you can import and use the button like so:

```tsx
import { Button } from '~/components/button'

const App = () => <Button>Click me</Button>
```

And that's it! You're now ready to start using Park UI in your Panda project.
