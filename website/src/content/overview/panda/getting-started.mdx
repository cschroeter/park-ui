## Setup Guide

<Steps>
<Step title="Prerequisite" number="1">

Before you start, ensure that your Panda project is set up and ready to go. If not, please refer to the
[Panda CSS Getting Started Guide](https://panda-css.com/docs/overview/getting-started#framework-guides) and once you've
completed that, come back to this guide.

</Step>
<Step title="Install Ark UI" number="2">

The first step is to install [Ark UI](https://ark-ui.com). Ark UI is a headless component library that forms the
foundation for most components. To install Ark UI, execute the following command in your project's root directory:

```bash multi
npm install @ark-ui/react
```

</Step>
<Step number="3" title="Install the Panda Presets">

The next package you will need is `@park-ui/panda-preset`. This package contains all the recipes and tokens explicitly
built for Ark UI's headless components.

```bash
npm install @park-ui/panda-preset -D
```

After you've installed the presets, you'll need to add it to your Panda configuration file along with your preferred
`jsxFramework` like shown below:

```tsx multi
import { defineConfig } from '@pandacss/dev'

export default defineConfig({
  preflight: true,
  presets: ['@pandacss/preset-base', '@park-ui/panda-preset'],
  include: ['./src/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}'],
  exclude: [],
  jsxFramework: 'react',
  outdir: 'styled-system',
})
```

Make sure to run `panda codegen` after you've added the presets to your Panda configuration file.

</Step>
<Step number="4" title="Styled Context">

Using a context provider allows for consistent styling across nested components without prop drilling, keeping your code
clean and maintainable.

Copy the following code and paste it into the `~/lib/create-style-context.tsx` file within your project:

<StyledContext />

**Please note:** If you use React, be aware that context require adding `'use client'` to the top of the file.

</Step>
<Step number="5" title="Add your first component">

To add a component, simply copy the code for the desired component and paste it into the appropriate place in your
project. Let's demonstrate this process using the `Button` component. First, copy the code for the component:

```tsx multi
import { ark } from '@ark-ui/react'
import { styled, type HTMLStyledProps } from 'styled-system/jsx'
import { button } from 'styled-system/recipes'

export const Button = styled(ark.button, button)
export interface ButtonProps extends HTMLStyledProps<typeof Button> {}
```

and paste it into your `components/button.tsx` file. Now you can import and use the button like so:

```tsx
import { Button } from '~/components/button'

const App = () => <Button>Click me</Button>
```

And that's it! You're now ready to start using Park UI in your Panda project.
