## [Unreleased]

## [0.38.0] - 2024-06-06

We are excited to announce that in this release, we have migrated all components to the new Ark UI 3.0.0 API. 
This update includes several breaking changes, so please make sure to update your code snippets accordingly.

## [0.34.1] - 2024-02-12

## [0.34.0] - 2024-02-08

### Added

Introduced a new `additionalColors` option in the `createPreset` function to decrease the CSS bundle size effectively. By default, the preset includes only the `gray` and `accent` colors. 
This maybe a breaking change for some users, so please update your configuration accordingly.

Example configuration:

```tsx
import { defineConfig } from '@pandacss/dev';
import { createPreset } from '@park-ui/panda-preset';

export default defineConfig({
  presets: [
    '@pandacss/preset-base',
    createPreset({
      accentColor: 'amber',
      grayColor: 'sand',
      additionalColors: ['red', 'green'],
    }),
  ],
  // Additional configuration...
})
```

To add all available colors, use this wildcard:

```tsx
createPreset({
  additionalColors: ['*'],
}),
```

  color with `borderRadius` of `sm`.

```jsx
import { defineConfig } from '@pandacss/dev'

export default defineConfig({
  presets: ['@pandacss/preset-base', '@park-ui/panda-preset'],
  // ...
})
```

To customize the Park UI preset, use the `createPreset` function as shown below:

```jsx
import { defineConfig } from '@pandacss/dev'
import { createPreset } from '@park-ui/panda-preset'

export default defineConfig({
  presets: [
    '@pandacss/preset-base',
    createPreset({
      accentColor: 'amber',
      grayColor: 'sand',
      borderRadius: 'none',
    }),
  ],
  // ...
})
```

### Changed

- Tweaked semantic color tokens for a more consistent look and feel.

## [0.19.0] - 2023-10-19

This is one of the biggest releases of Park UI so far. We've introduced a new way to configure presets, which will make
it easier to customize the theme to your needs. We've also replaced the default colors from `@pandacss/preset-base` with
[Radix Colors](https://www.radix-ui.com/colors).

The overall look and feel of Park UI has been improved as well. We've revised the `Card` and `Drawer` components and
tweaked many of the existing components to make them more consistent.

We've also started to work on a Taildwind CSS plugin that will allow you to use Park UI as a plugin in your Tailwind CSS
project. This is still a work in progress, but we're excited to share it with you soon.

In the light of these changes, we've renamed the `@park-ui/presets` package to `@park-ui/panda-preset`. We will continue
to support the old package name for the time being, but we recommend that you update your configuration to use the new
package name.

### Added

- `createPreset` function introduced for more convenient and flexible preset configuration. See the examples below for
  more details.
- Replaced default colors from `@pandacss/preset-base` with [Radix Colors](https://www.radix-ui.com/colors). This will
  allow us to provide more consistent colors when switching between light and dark mode.

### Changed

- Revised `Card` component.
- Revised `Drawer` component.

### Examples

**Before**: Extending Theme

```tsx
import { defineConfig } from '@pandacss/dev'

  theme: {
    extend: {
      tokens: {
        colors: {
          grayPalette: {
            25: { value: '#fcfcfc' },
            // etc ..
          },
        },
      },
      semanticTokens: {
        colors: {
          accent: {
            default: { value: { base: '{colors.indigo.500}', _dark: '{colors.indigo.200}' } },
            // etc ..
          },
        },
      },
    },
  },
  // ...
})
```
