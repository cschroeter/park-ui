The Park UI Figma Kit comes in 2 versions: The Foundations Kit and the Pro Kit.

## Base Kit

<FigmaKitPreview variant="foundation" />

The Foundations Kit contains the variables, styles and primitives of the Park UI design system. 
It also contains the Accent Variable Mode, which allows you to quickly switch between the standard black and white theme of Park UI
and an accent color theme of your liking. 

All in light and dark mode and Figma's own means - without any plugins! 
It also contains the most important components such as buttons, inputs, radios etc. for building interfaces. 

The Park UI Foundation Kit is available for free on [Figma Community](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1268615283036362769).


## Pro Kit

<FigmaKitPreview variant="pro" />

If you are looking for  ready-made interfaces and building blocks, the Pro Kit comes into play. It is based on the Foundations Kit and contain advanced interface elements such as cards, headers, footers or entire ready-made sections and pages. 
Due to its connection to the Foundations Kit, the Variable Mode can also be used here. If you are looking to accelerate your design workflow, we got you covered. 
Remember this is only the beginning. More components, sections and pages will be added in the coming weeks. The Pro Kit can be purchased here:
