Discover the Park UI Figma Kit, available in Foundations and Pro versions, both created by [Philipp Körner](https://twitter.com/Brainsandpixels).

## Base Kit

<FigmaKitPreview variant="foundation" />

Dive into Park UI design fundamentals with the Foundations Kit. It packs all you need: variables, styles, and essential UI components—buttons, inputs, radios, and more.

Use Accent Variable Mode for easy switching between classic and custom colors. Works in Figma directly, supporting both light and dark modes.

## Pro Kit

<FigmaKitPreview variant="pro" />

Elevate your design with the Pro Kit. Built atop the Foundations, it introduces complex UI elements like cards, headers, footers, and full-page layouts.

[Preview the Pro Kit](https://www.figma.com/file/wHbbw1P5b55vuPOhVfiPsx) in Figma and learn how it streamlines your design process, backed by the versatility of the Variable Mode.
