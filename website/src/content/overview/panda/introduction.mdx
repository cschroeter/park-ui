Park UI isn't a conventional component library. It's a valuable collection of re-usable components that you can effortlessly copy and paste into your applications.

## What does that mean?

When we say Park UI isn't a conventional component library, we mean its main function is not to serve as an installable package dependency that provides pre-made components for direct use. While Park UI does require the installation of Ark UI as a dependency and offers a Preset package for Panda, the primary purpose of Park UI is to provide code snippets for components that can be copied and integrated into your projects.

## So how does it work?

With Park UI, you're in the driver's seat. Simply browse through our comprehensive collection of components, select the ones that suit your needs, and then copy and paste the corresponding code snippets directly into your project. The beauty of this approach is twofold:

**Customization**: Once you've copied the component code, it's completely yours to modify. You can tailor each component to perfectly match your specific needs.

**Efficiency**: You only copy what you need. This means your project remains lean and clean, free of unnecessary dependencies.

We encourage you to use Park UI as a starting point, or a reference, in building your own component libraries or enhancing your existing ones.

Welcome to a new way of integrating high-quality components into your apps. Welcome to Park UI!
