## Init a project

Use the `init` command to initialize configuration for a new project.

```bash
npx @park-ui/cli init
```

The command will prompt you for some information about your project and write a `park-ui.json` file to the root of your
project.

```txt
- Which CSS framework do you use?: [Panda / Tailwind]
- Which JavaScript framework do you use?: [React / Solid / Vue]
- What is your import alias for components?: [~/components/ui]
- What is your import alias for utilities?: [~/lib]
- Would you like to write the configuration to park-ui.json?: [Yes / No]
```

## Add a component

After initializing your project, you can use the `add` command to add components to your project

```bash
npx @park-ui/cli add button
```

To add all components to your project, use the `--all` flag.

```bash
npx @park-ui/cli add --all
```
