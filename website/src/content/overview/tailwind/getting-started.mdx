## Setup Guide

<Steps>
<Step title="Prerequisite" number="1">

Before you start, ensure that your Tailwind CSS project is set up and ready to go. If not, please refer to the
[Tailwind CSS Getting Started Guide](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation) and once you've
completed that, come back to this guide.

</Step>
<Step title="Install Ark UI" number="2">

The first step is to install [Ark UI](https://ark-ui.com). Ark UI is a headless component library that forms the
foundation for most components. To install Ark UI, execute the following command in your project's root directory:

```bash multi
npm install @ark-ui/react
```

</Step>
<Step number="3" title="Install the Park UI Tailwind plugin">

The following package required is `@park-ui/tailwind-plugin`. This package includes the park-ui Tailwind plugin with the necessary stylesheets.

```bash
npm install @park-ui/tailwind-plugin
```

After you've installed the presets, you'll need to add it to your tailwind.config.js configuration file:

```jsx
const { parkwindPlugin } = require('@park-ui/tailwind-plugin')

module.exports = {
  plugins: [parkwindPlugin],
  content: ['./src/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}'],
  darkMode: ['class'],
}

```

Make sure to import the css preset. This will add the necessary styles to your project.

```tsx
import '@park-ui/tailwind-plugin/css/preset.css'
```

**Please note:** You also have the option to manually copy the recipes for specific components, which are provided
alongside the code examples. This approach gives you more control over which components to include in your project.
However, it will require a bit more effort on your part.

</Step>
<Step number="4" title="Setup Your Font Family">

By default, Park UI usees Plus Jakarta Sans. However, you are free to use any font family that aligns with your needs,
as long as it is mapped to the `--font-body` variable. The example below illustrates how to add a font family to the
body element within the Next.js framework.

```tsx
import type { Metadata } from 'next'
import { Plus_Jakarta_Sans } from 'next/font/google'
import { PropsWithChildren } from 'react'
import './global.css'

const body = Plus_Jakarta_Sans({ subsets: ['latin'], variable: '--font-body' })

export const metadata: Metadata = {
  title: 'Create Next App',
  description: 'Generated by create next app',
}

export default function RootLayout(props: PropsWithChildren) {
  return (
    <html lang="en">
      <body className={body.variable}>{props.children}</body>
    </html>
  )
}
```

</Step>
<Step number="5" title="Add your first component">

To add a component, simply copy the code for the desired component and paste it into the appropriate place in your project. Let's demonstrate this process using the `Button` component. First, copy the code for the component:

```tsx multi
import { ark, type HTMLArkProps } from '@ark-ui/react'
import { VariantProps } from 'tailwind-variants'
import { styled } from '~/lib/styled'
import { buttonStyles } from './recipe'

type ButtonVariantProps = VariantProps<typeof buttonStyles>
export type ButtonProps = ButtonVariantProps & HTMLArkProps<'button'>

export const Button = styled<ButtonProps>(ark.button, buttonStyles)
```

and paste it into your `components/button.tsx` file. Create a file recipe.ts in the same directory and paste the following styles recipe file:

```ts
import { tv } from 'tailwind-variants'

export const buttonStyles = tv({
  base: 'button',
  defaultVariants: {
    variant: 'solid',
    size: 'md',
  },
  variants: {
    variant: {
      solid: 'button--variant_solid',
      outline: 'button--variant_outline',
      ghost: 'button--variant_ghost',
      link: 'button--variant_link',
    },
    size: {
      xs: 'button--size_xs',
      sm: 'button--size_sm',
      md: 'button--size_md',
      lg: 'button--size_lg',
      xl: 'button--size_xl',
      '2xl': 'button--size_2xl',
    },
  },
})
```

Now you can import and use the button like so:

```tsx multi
import { Button } from '~/components/button'

const App = () => <Button variant="outline">Click me</Button>
```

And that's it! You're now ready to start using Park UI in your Tailwind CSS project.
