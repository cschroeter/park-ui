- Resolved an issue that broke the plugin startup without a parkUI config

## [0.12.0] - 2023-10-20

### Changed

This is one of the biggest releases of Park UI so far. We've introduced a new way to configure presets, which will make
it easier to customize the theme to your needs. We've also replaced the default colors with
[Radix Colors](https://www.radix-ui.com/colors).

The tailwind config respects now to configure the preset colors:

```js
const { parkwindPlugin } = require('./dist')

module.exports = {
  plugins: [parkwindPlugin],
  parkUI: {
    accentColor: 'amber',
    grayColor: 'sand',
    borderRadius: '2xl',
  },
  // ...rest of your config
}
```
