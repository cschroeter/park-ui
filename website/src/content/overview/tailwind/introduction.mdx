description: The only component library that lets you choose the JS/CSS framework

## Motivation

Most popular component libraries are designed for a specific JS framework and have their own way of styling components.
While this works fine for individuals and small businesses, it can be challenging for larger organizations or agencies
dealing with various clients or teams that use different frameworks.

In addition, most component libraries tightly couple component design and functionality, making it difficult to
customize and at times, impossible.

## Solution

Enter Park UI. Our goal is to put you in control allowing you to decide how the components are built and styled. Park UI
provides a set of components with sensible defaults that can be easily customized to fit your needs.

Unlike many other component libraries, Park UI doesn't ship as a single npm package. Instead, it ships various packages
tailored for each supported CSS framework. This allows you to only install the components you need and nothing more.
